Heraldry
========

Why this project?
-----------------
Because Heraldry is beautiful, interesting, inspiring and awesome!

What is SVG and why this format?
--------------------------------
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
I chose this format because it is W3C compliant (http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/svg) which means the chances are high this file -- and filetype -- will run smoothly on your browser: 

- Mozilla Firefox,
- Opera,
- Google Chrome,
- Webkit,
- Safari... 
- (that does not mean you **Internet Explorer**).

Besides that is very likely for this file to be used/opened without any further problems in you Adobe Illustrator, Corel DRAW! or other proprietary vector graphics program. The opposite is, as you all know, rarely true. :'-(

What is your motivation?
------------------------
Spread the Heraldry love all over! **<3**

Why Heraldry?
-------------
Why NOT!?
Because it can be used on the web in your site, printed as a graphics for your shirt (even pollo shirt!) and lots of other cool places! Possibilites are endless.

Why Inkscape?
-------------
Because it is opensource and it runs everywhere. Windows, Linux, Mac... you name it!
This increases the chance of collaboration AND reusability.

Final words?
------------
We hope they soon take the web by storm like .GIF files did in the 90's (alongside with animated .PNG files!).
