Why this project?
-----------------
Because SVG _(Scalable Vector Graphics)_ graphics are a lot of fun! They can be edited on **all** major operating systems ou there today ( **Windows, Linux and Mac** ) and on all **modern** _(Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Webkit...)_ web browsers (Did you hear me __Internet Explorer__ ? ;-(

We hope they soon take the web by storm like **.GIF** files did in the 90's. ;)
