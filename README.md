Heraldry
========

Why this project?
-----------------
Because Heraldry is beautiful, interesting, inspiring and awesome!

What is SVG and why this format?
--------------------------------
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
I choose this format because it is W3C compliant (http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/svg) which means the chances are high this file type will run smoothly on yor browser and Operating System. (That does not mean you _Internet Explorer_).

Besides that is very likely for this file to open without any further problems in you Adobe Illustrator, Corel DRAW! or other proprietary vector graphics program. The opposite is, as you all know, rarely true.

What is your motivation?
------------------------
Spread the Heraldry love all over! **<3**

Why Heraldry?
-------------
Why NOT!?

Why Inkscape?
-------------
Because it is opensource and it runs everywhere. Windows, Linux, Mac... you name it!
This increases the chance of collaboration AND reusability of these files.

Final words?
------------
We hope they soon take the web by storm like **.GIF** files did in the 90's (alongside with animated .PNG files!).
